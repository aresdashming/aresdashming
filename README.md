## 🛠️ Projects & Practice

**Ad Monitoring System**
- Built a data collection pipeline for advertising & e-commerce scenarios
- Implemented dynamic web crawling with Selenium to handle rendering and anti-bot mechanisms
- Designed rule-based features (exposure frequency, price changes, keyword matching)  
→ Data preparation for monitoring and anomaly detection

**Android Intelligent Applications**
- Developed multiple Android apps centered on user data analysis and decision support
- Implemented rule-based evaluation and recommendation logic for:
  - health monitoring
  - meal recommendation
  - time planning
- Modular design to support future ML or cloud-based extensions

**3D RPG Game (Unity)**
- Designed and implemented a complete 3D RPG system using Unity and C#
- Modeled character states and behaviors with FSM and rule-based strategies
- Implemented combat logic, inventory, skills, and task systems

**Qt-based Medical Monitoring System**
- Designed and developed a desktop medical monitoring system using Qt and C/C++
- Built the full pipeline from data acquisition to visualization
- Designed extensible health evaluation logic
- Led a small student team to complete system development
